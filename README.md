# John-Wedding (my first ElysiaJS Project)

Hello ! this is my first (almost) complete project of a Wedding Organizer web, I will soon upload the full ver. Frontend fully made with React.js and Tailwind CSS while Backend is based on Elysia JS.
I'm currently deploying the web for a while so you can try it, here : https://john-wedding.pages.dev/


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.3. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
